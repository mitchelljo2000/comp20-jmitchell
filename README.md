1. What is the purpose of this Git repository.

The purpose of this Git repository is mainly for revision control. It gives me
access to previous versions of the code I've written that I may want to revisit.

2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignent was assignment 2: The Ride Sharing Service. This was my
favorite assignment because it gave me an idea of how valuable the information
we were being taught was. Using the skills that we had cultivated through
lectures and previous assignments, we built something that had some semblance
of practical use. While we only created a really bad version of Uber, it still
showed me what I'd be capable of with the knowledge I was obtaining.

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

I believe I've grown tremendously from day 1 of this course to now. I've
become familar with new programming languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
I was also introduced to doing revision control through git and github. Knowing
more programming languages only serves to make me a better programmer, and my
familiarity with github will definitely help me in the future due to its use
as somewhat of a portfolio when looking for jobs in the future.

4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course?

The most important thing I learned in this course was how to work efficiently
with others to complete your goal. While working on the semester group project,
we split up the work so that multiple tasks could be completed simultaneously,
thus increasing the speed at which the project was being done. Also, when I
encountered big issues while doing the assignments, I went to a teaching 
assistant to ask for help rather than mulling over a problem for hours
upon hours to no avail, thus saving time and energy.

5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve
deeper into?

In class, Ming stated that creating an IOS app using swift and connecting it to
the web server we made for assignment 3 would be a good project. I believe it
would be in my best interest to try my hand at completing this project due to
my interest in creating applications for mobile devices and to become more
familiar with working on the server side since it is the topic in which I need
the most improvement.
